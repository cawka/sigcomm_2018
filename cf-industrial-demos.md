The industrial demo sessions at SIGCOMM 2015 and 2016 had a great turnout and positive feedback, so the Industrial Demos session will return for SIGCOMM 2018. The industrial demo session showcases demos from industry in the area of networking, networked systems, as well as new forms of network intelligence and networked applications. The objective of this session is to bring together industry and academia around demos of innovative and cutting-edge networking technology and products.

## Why Present Industrial Demos at SIGCOMM?

SIGCOMM is the flagship annual conference of the ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication (SIGCOMM) on the applications, technologies, architectures, and protocols for computer communication. The conference is single-track and features a high-quality technical program with significant opportunities for technical and social interactions. SIGCOMM is the premier conference in its field and typically attracts over 600 attendees (scientists, engineers, educators, and students).

An industrial demo is an opportunity for companies to show industrial leadership and innovative thinking. Presenting cutting edge industrial technology will attract top academics to work on problems that are relevant to industry and help push forward the frontier of industrial knowledge. The industrial demo session is also a great recruiting opportunity. SIGCOMM attracts students from the most selective universities around the world.

## How to Submit?

Please submit a small description of your demo (up to one page) together with the names and affiliation of the demo presenters at [https://sigcomm17industrialdemos.hotcrp.com](https://sigcomm17industrialdemos.hotcrp.com). The Industrial Demo Chairs are responsible for the selection of industrial demo program in conjunction with SIGCOMM industrial liaison board.

Demos of research projects from industry are better suited for the general SIGCOMM demo session; the industrial demo session has more of a product and upcoming technology focus. Feel free to contact Industrial Demo Chairs or the demo chairs if you have any questions.

## What to Expect?

Accepted demos will be scheduled in a two-hour session at the conference, during which the demo will need to be manned. Demos can stay up during the entire day, so it is possible to show it to participants during breaks as well. Demos that utilize wireless networks must be prepared to arrange appropriate spectrum sharing with other such demos at the venue. Demos that require large amounts of Internet uplink capacity are unlikely to find that available at the venue.
